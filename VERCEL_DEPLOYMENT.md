# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Ready for Vercel Deployment!

Your Facebook clone has been optimized for Vercel deployment. The Express.js backend has been converted to Next.js API routes, making it a single deployable application.

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository: `https://github.com/kiro9806-source/test`
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy immediately
6. Your app will be live at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts to link your project
```
